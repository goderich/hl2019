## Neogrammarian hypothesis

- In a nutshell:
  - Sound changes are regular
- Why is this important?

## Terms

- Cognate
  - A word related to words in sister languages, **directly inherited** from an ancestral language
- Sound correspondence
  - A set of sounds in related languages that descend from a common ancestral sound

## Identifying a genetic relationship

- Find cognates
- Establish sound correspondences

## Finding cognates

- Start with basic vocabulary
- Find words that are *identical* in meaning and similar in form
- Establish sound correspondences

## Establishing sound correspondences

- Create a table of sounds corresponding to each other
  - Note the environment
- A single segment may correspond to zero or two segments
- Sound corresponces must be **regular** and **recurrent**

## Word of caution

- You have to account for **all** segments in **all** cognates
- It's better to miss a cognate at first than to include a non-cognate

## Example

![](sc-walkthrough.png){ .stretch }
